## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
# Airbnb_Berlin_Project_1
This is the project 1 of my Udacity Data Science Nano Degree. In this project i have answered three business questions following the CRISP-DM approach, about Airbnb properties in Berlin. The motivation of this project came from the fact that whenever you, as a traveller, plan to travel to a new city, you look for the best possible accomodation. everyone has their own definition of 'best' but i thought of the following three questions

1. **Which neighbourhoods are most popular for Airbnb locations in Berlin?**
2. **What is the average price of Airbnb in Berlin?**
3. **What features influence the price?**

I have answered my questions using the listing Data that was provided by Airbnb. You will find the code and the conclusions of all the abov mentioned questions, in their respective notebooks. 



## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

- Pandas
- Numpy

For **Visualizing** i used the following:

- Matplotlib


For **Modelling** i used the following:

- Sklearn



## File Descriptions<a name="descriptions"></a>

In this repository I have uploaded three jupyter notebooks, 1 Readme file and 1 Dataset.

The files are descibed below.
- **Question_1**: In this file i have answered my first questions using the listing database. In the file you will find preprocessing of the data along with Graphs and the conclusions at the end.

- **Question_2**: In this file i have answered my first questions using the listing database. In the file you will find preprocessing of the data along with Graphs and the conclusions at the end.

- **Question_3**: In this file i have answered my first questions using the listing database. In the file you will find preprocessing of the data along with Graphs and the conclusions at the end.

- **listing.csv**: This is the official dataset of Airbnb Berlin listing.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>
I have written my conclusion for each question in their respective jupyter notebook.
